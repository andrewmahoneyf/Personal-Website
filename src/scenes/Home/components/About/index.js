        Besides being a full-time student, Andrew runs two companies and has consistently worked internships throughout his education. Currently, Andrew is a software development intern at Liberty Mutual in Boston, MA. His work has been
        highly valuable in providing both technical and management experience in multiple industries as well as international engagement.

      <p className="lead">
        Andrew&apos;s passion for technology led to the creation of his two companies; Dubdev, a web and app development company, and Coinglomerate LLC, a data-driven tech startup. After being inspired by building his first Linux powered
        mining computer (pictured in the photo), Andrew co-founded Coinglomerate with minds he met at the UW Blockchain Society. Andrew provides his expertise in the industry, hardware, Linux, and scripting to offer software solutions for
        mining and build optimized computers.

      <p className="lead">
        Andrew is always looking for new opportunities to expand his skill set and further his expertise in web development. He accepted a software development internship in Boston with Liberty Mutual for the summer, and will continue his
        work for the Department of Statistics. His work as the statistics webmaster includes constant site updates and technical support for the entire department. Previously, he helped transfer their old, hard-coded website to Drupal for
        easier management. This past year at SteppIR, he was a product manager helping the company restructure their business and product line. Andrew spent the past summer interning for two companies in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil; gaining valuable
        experience and skills with Sidera Consult and a tech startup called Altalova. Through his coursework, Andrew was able to actively control Sidera&apos;s WordPress account and create a price simulator for Altalova using JavaScript,
        HTML5, and CSS. Prior to his trip to Brazil, he interned for a private investor in Seattle as well as worked full-time as a supervisor for a valet company while continuing his education.
